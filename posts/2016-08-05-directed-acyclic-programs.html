<p>One of the biggest problems in software world is that most of the people don’t really care about what would happen when their program gets bigger.</p>

<p>It is very dangerous to write code that has potential to change something vital in the program. (aka <strong>Side Effects!</strong>)</p>
<p>Let’s think about the code as a graph and make some assumptions so that;</p>
<ul>
<li>An expression is a node in the graph.</li>
<li>Edges (connections between nodes) are the calls to other expressions inside expressions (parameters of functions).</li>
<li><code>e1(e2, e3)</code> means <code>e1</code> is connected to <code>e2</code> and <code>e3</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be continued…</p>
