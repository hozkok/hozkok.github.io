                        Why do we mutate everything?
                        <aside class="notes">
                            Mutation is how imperative languages work by default.
                            Defaults are important, because when we learn a
                            language, we use its built-in features to solve our
                            problems.

                            Traditional OO languages tend to make us think of
                            composites as something other than values. We are
                            stuck to think on a specific paradigm to solve all
                            the problems, which might as well cause problem in
                            the future.

                        everything is frozen.  Values do not change. Only the
                        state of the entities would change.  Considering the
                        time as an atomic point in the flow of the states would
                        help on thinking about values. In a single point, the
                        state will not change.

                            Concurrency is about running two or more tasks in
                            overlapping time periods. Again, the point in time
                            refers to the most atomic task in the domain. In
                            CPU level, it could be an instruction. Database
                            transactions in some DBMSs could also be considered
                            as point in time in that case even if the operation
                            is not completed in an atomic time in another

                    Caching
                    - In a language, compiler-level optimizations could be done
                    - In a language, runtime object reference caching could be done
                    - e.g. python strings
                    - We already use this kind of caching in browsers!
                    - Shallow Comparison == Deep Comparison !
                    - No need for expensive deep copying.
                    - Fast *diff*s
